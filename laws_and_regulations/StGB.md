The Strafgesetzbuch regulates the core matter of substantive criminal law in Germany. While it determines the preconditions and legal consequences of criminal action, the procedure for enforcing its norms, the criminal procedure, is regulated by a separate code of law - the Code of Criminal Procedure.
