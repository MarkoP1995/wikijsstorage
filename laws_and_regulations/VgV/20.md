(1) When determining the deadlines for the receipt of offers and requests to participate in accordance with sections 15 to 19, the complexity of the service and the time for preparing the offers must be taken into account appropriately. Section 38 paragraph 3 remains unaffected.
(2) If offers can only be made after a visit to the place of performance or after having inspected the annexes to the tender documents on site at the contracting authority, the offer deadlines are to be set in such a way that all companies are informed of all information necessary for the preparation of the offer are required to be able to take note under normal circumstances.
(3) The offer deadlines are to be extended, apart from the cases regulated in ยง 41 paragraph 2 and 3,
1. if additional information is not made available at least six days before the end of the offer period despite being requested in time by a company; in the cases of section 15 subsection 3, section 16 subsection 7 or section 17 subsection 8, this period is four days, or
2. if the contracting authority makes significant changes to the tender documents.

The extension of the deadline must be proportionate to the importance of the information or change and ensure that all companies can take note of the information or changes. This does not apply if the information or change is irrelevant for the preparation of the offer or the information was not requested in time.
