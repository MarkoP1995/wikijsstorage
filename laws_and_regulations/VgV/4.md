(1) Several contracting authorities may agree to jointly award certain public contracts. This also applies to the awarding of contracts together with contracting authorities from other Member States of the European Union. The options for using central procurement offices remain unaffected.
(2) Insofar as the award procedure is carried out jointly in the name and on behalf of all contracting authorities, they are jointly responsible for compliance with the provisions on the award procedure. This also applies if a contracting authority carries out the procedure on its own behalf and on behalf of the other contracting authorities. If only partially carried out jointly, the contracting authorities are only jointly responsible for those parts that were carried out jointly. If a contract is awarded jointly by contracting authorities from different Member States of the European Union, they determine the responsibilities and the applicable provisions of national law by agreement and state this in the contract documents.
(3) The Federal Government may issue general administrative regulations on the establishment and use of central procurement agencies as well as the procurement services to be provided by the central procurement agencies for federal agencies in appropriate areas.
