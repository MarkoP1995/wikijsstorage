(1) For the sending, receiving, forwarding and storage of data in an award procedure, the contracting authority and the companies generally use devices and programs for electronic data transmission (electronic means).
(2) Communication in a procurement procedure can take place orally if it does not concern the procurement documents, the applications to participate, the confirmations of interest or the offers and if it is adequately and appropriately documented.
(3) The contracting authority may require each company to provide a unique company name and an electronic address (registration). The contracting authority may not require registration for access to the contract notice and the tender documents; voluntary registration is permitted.
