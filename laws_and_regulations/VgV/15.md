(1) In an open procedure, the contracting authority publicly requests an unlimited number of companies to submit offers. Any interested company can submit an offer.
(2) The deadline for the receipt of the offers (offer period) is at least 35 days, calculated from the day after the dispatch of the contract notice.
(3) In the event that adequately justified urgency makes it impossible to meet the deadline set out in paragraph 2, the contracting authority may set a deadline which must not be less than 15 days from the day following the dispatch of the contract notice.
(4) The contracting authority may shorten the period referred to in paragraph 2 by five days if it accepts the electronic transmission of the offers.
(5) The contracting authority may only require the bidders to be informed about the offer or its suitability. Negotiations, in particular about changes in offers or prices, are not permitted.
