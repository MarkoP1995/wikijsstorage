(1) The author is entitled to a separate, appropriate remuneration if the contracting partner takes up a new type of work according to ยง 31a, which was agreed at the time the contract was concluded, but was still unknown. ยง 32 (2) and (4) apply accordingly. The contractual partner must immediately inform the author of the inclusion of the new type of work use.
(2) If the contractual partner has transferred the right of use to a third party, the third party is liable for the remuneration in accordance with paragraph 1 when the new type of work is used. The contractual partner is not liable.
(3) The rights under paragraphs 1 and 2 cannot be waived in advance. However, the author can grant a simple right of use for everyone free of charge.
