(1) Anyone who unlawfully violates copyright law or another law protected under this law can be claimed by the injured person to have the impairment removed or, if there is a risk of repetition, to refrain from doing so. The right to an injunction also exists if an infringement threatens for the first time.
(2) Anyone who intentionally or negligently carries out the act is obliged to compensate the injured party for the damage resulting therefrom. When assessing damages, the profit that the infringer has made by violating the law can also be taken into account. The claim for damages can also be calculated on the basis of the amount that the infringer should have paid as reasonable remuneration if he had obtained permission to use the infringed right. Authors, authors of scientific editions (ยง 70), photographers (ยง 72) and performing artists (ยง 73) can also request compensation in cash for the damage that is not financial loss, if and insofar as this is fair.
