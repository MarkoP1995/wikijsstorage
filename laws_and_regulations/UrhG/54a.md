(1) Decisive for the amount of remuneration is the extent to which the devices and storage media are actually used as types for reproductions in accordance with § 53 subsection 1 or 2 or §§ 60a to 60f. It must be taken into account to what extent technical protective measures according to § 95a are applied to the plants concerned.
(2) The remuneration for devices is to be designed in such a way that it is also appropriate with regard to the remuneration obligation for storage media contained in these devices or other devices or storage media that functionally interact with them.
(3) When determining the amount of remuneration, the usage-relevant properties of the devices and storage media, in particular the performance of devices and the storage capacity and multiple writeability of storage media, must be taken into account.
(4) The remuneration may not unreasonably affect manufacturers of devices and storage media; it must be in an economically reasonable ratio to the price level of the device or the storage medium.
