(1) A contract by which the author undertakes to grant rights of use to future works that are not specified at all or are determined only in terms of type, must be in writing. It can be terminated by both parties to the contract five years after the conclusion of the contract. The notice period is six months if no shorter period has been agreed.
(2) The right of termination cannot be waived in advance. Other contractual or statutory termination rights remain unaffected.
(3) If rights of use have been granted to future works in fulfillment of the contract, the disposition with regard to the works that have not yet been delivered at this time will become invalid upon termination of the contract.
