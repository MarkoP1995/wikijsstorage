(1) A right of use can only be transferred with the consent of the author. The author may not refuse consent in good faith.
(2) If rights of use are transferred to the individual works included in the collective work with the right of use to a collective work (Section 4), the consent of the author of the collective work is sufficient.
(3) A right of use can be transferred without the consent of the author if the transfer takes place as part of the overall sale of a company or the sale of parts of a company. The author can recall the right of use if he cannot reasonably be expected to exercise the right of use by the purchaser. Sentence 2 also applies if the ownership structure in the company of the holder of the right of use changes significantly.
(4) The purchaser of the right of use is jointly and severally liable for the fulfillment of the seller's obligations arising from the contract with the author if the author has not expressly consented to the transfer of the right of use in individual cases.
(5) The author cannot waive the right of recall and the liability of the purchaser in advance. The owner of the right of use and the author can agree otherwise.
