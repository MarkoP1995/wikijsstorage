(1) The right to reproduce is the right to produce copies of the work, regardless of whether temporary or permanent, in which procedure and in what number.
(2) Reproduction is also the transfer of the work to devices for the repeatable reproduction of image or sound sequences (image or sound carrier), regardless of whether it is the recording of a reproduction of the work on an image or sound carrier or a transfer of the work is from one image or sound carrier to another.
