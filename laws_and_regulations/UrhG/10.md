(1) Anyone who is designated as the author on the copies of a published work or on the original of a work of fine arts in the usual manner is regarded as the author of the work until proven otherwise; this also applies to a designation known as the author's alias or artist's mark.
(2) If the author is not designated in accordance with paragraph 1, it is presumed that he is authorized to assert the rights of the author who is designated as the publisher on the copies of the work. If no publisher is specified, it is assumed that the publisher is authorized.
(3) For the holder of exclusive rights of use, the presumption of paragraph 1 applies accordingly, insofar as it concerns proceedings of interim legal protection or injunctive relief claims are made. The presumption does not apply in relation to the author or the original holder of the related property right.
