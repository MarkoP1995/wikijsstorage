(1) Computer programs within the meaning of this Act are programs in any form, including the design material.
(2) The protection granted applies to all forms of expression of a computer program. Ideas and principles underlying an element of a computer program, including the ideas and principles underlying the interfaces, are not protected.
(3) Computer programs are protected if they represent individual works in the sense that they are the result of the author's own intellectual creation. No other criteria, especially non-qualitative or aesthetic ones, should be used to determine their ability to protect.
(4) Unless otherwise specified in this section, the provisions applicable to language works apply to computer programs.
(5) The provisions of §§ 32d, 32e, 36 to 36c, 40a and 95a to 95d do not apply to computer programs.
