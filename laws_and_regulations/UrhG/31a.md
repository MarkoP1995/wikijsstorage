(1) A contract by which the author grants or undertakes rights for unknown types of use must be in writing. The written form is not required if the author grants a simple right of use for everyone free of charge. The author can revoke this granting of rights or the obligation to do so. The right of withdrawal expires three months after the other has sent the author the intended address for the new type of work to the author at the last known address.
(2) The right of withdrawal does not apply if the parties have agreed on a remuneration according to ยง 32c (1) after becoming aware of the new type of use. The right of withdrawal also lapses if the parties have agreed the remuneration according to a common remuneration rule. It expires with the author's death.
(3) If several works or work contributions are combined to form a whole, which can only be appropriately exploited in the new way of use by using all works or work contributions, the author cannot exercise the right of withdrawal contrary to good faith.
(4) The rights under paragraphs 1 to 3 cannot be waived in advance.
