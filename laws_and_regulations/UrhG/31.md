(1) The author can grant another the right to use the work for individual or all types of use (right of use). The right of use can be granted as a simple or exclusive right as well as limited in space, time or content.
(2) The simple right of use entitles the owner to use the work in the permitted manner without excluding use by others.
(3) The exclusive right of use entitles the owner to use the work to the exclusion of all other persons in the manner permitted by him and to grant rights of use. It can be determined that the use by the author is reserved. Section 35 remains unaffected.
(4) (dropped out)
(5) If the types of use are not expressly specified individually when granting a right of use, the type of use to which the contract is based determines the types of use. The same applies to the question of whether a right of use is granted, whether it is a simple or exclusive right of use, how far the right of use and the right to prohibit extend and what restrictions the right of use is subject to.
