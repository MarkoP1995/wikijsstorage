1. it only makes a subordinate contribution to a work, product or service; A contribution is subordinate, in particular, if it has little impact on the overall impression of a work or the nature of a product or service, for example because it does not belong to the typical content of a work, product or service,
2. it is a work of architecture or the design of such a work,
3. the work is intended for a trademark or other hallmark, design or community design with the consent of the author, or
