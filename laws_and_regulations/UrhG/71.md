(1) Anyone who allows a work that has not appeared to appear for the first time after the expiry of copyright or for the first time publicly reproduces it has the exclusive right to exploit the work. The same applies to unpublished works that were never protected within the scope of this law, but whose author has been dead for more than seventy years. §§ 5 and 10 (1) and §§ 15 to 24, 26, 27, 44a to 63 and 88 are to be applied accordingly.
(2) The right is transferable.
(3) The right expires twenty-five years after the publication of the work or, if it was made public for the first time earlier, after this. The deadline is to be calculated in accordance with § 69.
