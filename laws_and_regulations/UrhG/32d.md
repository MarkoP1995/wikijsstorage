(2) The claim according to paragraph 1 is excluded if
1. the author has made a subordinate contribution to a work, product or service; A contribution is subordinate, in particular, if it has little impact on the overall impression of a work or the nature of a product or a service, for example because it does not belong to the typical content of a work, a product or a service, or
