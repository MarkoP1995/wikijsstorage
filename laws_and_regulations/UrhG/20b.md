(1) The right to transmit a broadcast work as part of a simultaneous, unchanged and completely retransmitted program by cable systems or microwave systems (cable retransmission) can only be asserted by a collecting society. This does not apply to rights that a broadcaster asserts in relation to its broadcasts.
(2) If the author has granted the right to transmit the cable to a broadcasting company or a sound carrier or film manufacturer, the cable company must nevertheless pay the author an appropriate remuneration for the cable transmission. The right to remuneration cannot be waived. It can only be assigned to a collecting society in advance and can only be asserted by one. This regulation does not conflict with collective agreements, company agreements and common remuneration rules for broadcasting companies, provided that the author is granted appropriate remuneration for each cable transmission.
