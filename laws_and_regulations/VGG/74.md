This part does not apply insofar as the collecting society grants online rights to musical works to broadcasting companies that transcend territories on the basis of a voluntary bundling of the necessary online rights and in compliance with the competition rules pursuant to Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union they need to make their radio or television programs publicly available or accessible at the same time as or after the program as well as other online content, including previews, which were produced by or for the broadcasting company in addition to the first program.
