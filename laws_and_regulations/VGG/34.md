(1) The collecting society is obliged, on the basis of the rights exercised by it, to grant anyone rights of use on request at reasonable conditions. In particular, the conditions must be objective, non-discriminatory and include appropriate remuneration.
(2) The collecting society does not already violate its non-discrimination obligation because it does not grant the terms agreed between it and the provider of a new type of online service to another provider of a similar type of online service. What is new is an online service that has been available to the public in the European Union or another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area for less than three years.
