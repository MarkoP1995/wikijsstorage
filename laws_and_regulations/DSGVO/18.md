(1) The data subject has the right to request the controller to restrict processing if one of the following conditions is met:
1. the correctness of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period of time that enables the controller to check the correctness of the personal data,
2. the processing is unlawful and the data subject refuses to delete the personal data and instead requests that the use of the personal data be restricted;
3. the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of processing, but the data subject needs them to assert, exercise or defend legal claims, or
4. the data subject has objected to the processing pursuant to Article 21 paragraph 1, as long as it is not certain whether the legitimate reasons of the controller outweigh those of the data subject.

(2) If processing has been restricted in accordance with paragraph 1, this personal data - apart from its storage - may only be obtained with the consent of the data subject or to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person or for important reasons processed in the public interest of the Union or a Member State.
(3) A data subject who has obtained a restriction of processing in accordance with paragraph 1 will be informed by the person responsible before the restriction is lifted.
