(1) If the violation of the protection of personal data is likely to result in a high risk for the personal rights and freedoms of natural persons, the person responsible will immediately inform the data subject of the violation.
(2) The notification to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 describes in a clear and simple language the type of violation of the protection of personal data and contains at least the information and recommendations mentioned in Article 33 paragraph 3 letters b, c and d.
(3) The notification of the data subject in accordance with paragraph 1 is not required if one of the following conditions is met:
1. the person responsible has taken appropriate technical and organizational security precautions and these precautions have been applied to the personal data affected by the violation, in particular those which make the personal data inaccessible to all persons who are not authorized to access the personal data, through encryption,
2. the person responsible has taken the following measures to ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects in accordance with paragraph 1 no longer exists in all likelihood,
3. this would involve disproportionate effort. In this case, a public announcement or a similar measure must be carried out instead, through which the data subjects are informed in a comparable effective manner.

(4) If the controller has not already notified the data subject of the personal data breach, the supervisory authority may request the controller to do so, taking into account the likelihood that the personal data breach is at risk, or they may determine by resolution that certain of the conditions set out in paragraph 3 are met.
