(1) The data subject has the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from their particular situation, to the processing of personal data relating to them which is based on Article 6 paragraph 1 letters e or f; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The controller no longer processes the personal data unless he can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that outweigh the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
(2) If personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data relating to them for the purpose of such advertising; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is connected to such direct advertising.
(3) If the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes.
(4) The data subject must be expressly advised of the right specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 at the latest when they first communicate with him; this notice must be given in an understandable form that is separate from other information.
(5) In connection with the use of information society services, regardless of Directive 2002/58 / EC, the data subject can exercise their right to object using automated procedures that use technical specifications.
(6) The data subject has the right to object, for reasons arising from their particular situation, to the processing of their personal data relating to them, which is carried out for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89 (1) because processing is necessary to fulfill a task in the public interest.
