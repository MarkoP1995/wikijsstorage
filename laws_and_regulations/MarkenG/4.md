The trademark protection arises
1. by entering a trademark as a trademark in the register maintained by the German Patent and Trademark Office,
2. through the use of a sign in commercial transactions, insofar as the sign has acquired validity as a brand within the relevant public, or
3. through the notorious recognition of a trademark within the meaning of Article 6bis of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (Paris Convention).
