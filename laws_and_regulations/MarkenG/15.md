(1) The acquisition of protection of a business name grants its holder an exclusive right.
(2) Third parties are prohibited from unauthorized use of the business name or a similar sign in trade in a manner that is likely to cause confusion with the protected name.
(3) If the business name is a business name known in Germany, third parties are also prohibited from using the business name or a similar symbol in business dealings if there is no risk of confusion within the meaning of paragraph 2, insofar as the use of the mark unfairly exploits or impairs the distinctive character or the appreciation of the business name for no justifiable reason.
(4) Anyone who uses a business name or a similar sign contrary to paragraph 2 or paragraph 3 can be claimed by the owner of the business name if there is a risk of repetition. The claim also exists if there is a risk of an infringement.
(5) Anyone who deliberately or negligently commits the infringement is obliged to compensate the damage resulting from the business name holder. Section 14 (6) sentences 2 and 3 apply accordingly.
(6) Section 14 (7) applies accordingly.
