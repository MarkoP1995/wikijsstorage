(1) The decisions of the German Patent and Trade Mark Office, even if they have been announced in accordance with sentence 3, must be justified and sent to the parties ex officio in copy; authentication of the transcript is not required. Copies are only issued at the request of a party and only on paper. If a hearing has taken place, they can also be announced at the end of the hearing. A reason is not required if only the applicant or proprietor of the trademark is involved in the procedure and his application is granted.
(2) Upon notification of the decision, the parties concerned shall be informed of the legal remedy against the decision, the place where the appeal must be lodged, the deadline for appeal and, if a fee is payable under the Patent Costs Act, to teach about the fee. The time limit for the appeal begins only if the parties have been instructed in accordance with sentence 1. If the instruction is omitted or incorrect, the appeal may only be lodged within one year of the notification being served, unless the party concerned has been instructed in writing that there is no appeal. Section 91 applies accordingly. Sentences 1 to 4 apply mutatis mutandis to the remedy of remembrance according to ยง 64.
