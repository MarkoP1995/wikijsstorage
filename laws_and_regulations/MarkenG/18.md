(1) The owner of a trademark or business name can claim the infringer in the cases of Sections 14, 15 and 17 for the destruction of the illegally labeled goods in the possession or property of the infringer. Sentence 1 is to be applied accordingly to the materials and devices owned by the infringer, which have primarily served to illegally label the goods.
(2) The owner of a brand or business name can claim the infringer in the cases of Sections 14, 15 and 17 by recalling illegally labeled goods or by removing them permanently from the distribution channels.
(3) The claims according to paragraphs 1 and 2 are excluded if the claim is disproportionate in individual cases. When checking proportionality, the legitimate interests of third parties must also be taken into account.
