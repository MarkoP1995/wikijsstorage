(1) Telecommunications secrecy is subject to the content of telecommunications and their circumstances, in particular whether someone is or was involved in a telecommunications operation. The telecommunications secret also extends to the circumstances surrounding unsuccessful connection attempts.
(2) Every service provider is obliged to maintain telecommunications secrecy. The obligation to maintain secrecy continues even after the end of the activity by which it was founded.
(3) The parties obliged under paragraph 2 are prohibited from gaining knowledge of the content or the closer circumstances of telecommunications beyond what is necessary for the business provision of telecommunications services, including the protection of their technical systems. You may only use knowledge of facts that are subject to telecommunications secrecy for the purpose stated in sentence 1. Use of this knowledge for other purposes, in particular passing it on to others, is only permitted insofar as this law or another statutory provision so provides and expressly relates to telecommunication processes. The notification obligation under Section 138 of the Criminal Code takes precedence.
(4) If the telecommunications system is on board a water or aircraft, there is no obligation to keep the secret to the person who is driving the vehicle or to its representative.
