(1) If a contracting party has contractually reserved the withdrawal or is entitled to a statutory right of withdrawal, the services received must be returned in the event of withdrawal and the benefits used must be surrendered.
(2) Instead of the restitution or surrender, the debtor has to pay compensation, if so
1. the restitution or surrender is excluded according to the nature of what has been obtained,
2. he has used, sold, encumbered, processed or transformed the item received,
3. the item received has deteriorated or has perished; however, the deterioration caused by the intended use is not taken into account.

If a consideration is specified in the contract, it is to be used as the basis for the calculation of the value replacement; If the use benefit of a loan is to be replaced, it can be demonstrated that the value of the use benefit was lower.
(3) There is no obligation to compensate
1. if the defect justifying withdrawal has only become apparent during processing or remodeling of the item,
2. insofar as the creditor is responsible for the deterioration or destruction or the damage would also have occurred to him,
3. if in the case of a statutory right of withdrawal, the deterioration or loss has occurred at the beneficiary, even though he has observed the care that he uses in his own affairs.

Any remaining enrichment is to be released.
(4) The creditor can claim compensation for breach of an obligation under paragraph 1 in accordance with §§ 280 to 283.
