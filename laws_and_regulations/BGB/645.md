If, prior to acceptance, the work has perished, deteriorated or cannot be carried out due to a defect in the material supplied by the purchaser or as a result of instructions given by the purchaser for the execution, without any circumstance for which the entrepreneur is responsible, then the Entrepreneurs demand part of the remuneration corresponding to the work performed and reimbursement of expenses not included in the remuneration.
