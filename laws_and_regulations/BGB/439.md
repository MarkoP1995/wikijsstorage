(1) As a supplementary performance, the buyer can choose to have the defect remedied or to deliver a defect-free item.
(2) The seller must bear the expenses required for the purpose of supplementary performance, in particular transport, travel, labor and material costs.
(3) If the buyer has incorporated the defective item in another item or attached it to another item in accordance with its type and intended use, the seller is obliged as part of the supplementary performance to provide the buyer with the necessary expenses for removing the defective item and installing or installing the item to replace repaired or delivered defect-free goods. [§ 442](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/442) (1) is to be applied with the proviso that, for the knowledge of the buyer, the installation or attachment of the defective item by the buyer takes the place of the conclusion of the contract.
(4) The seller can refuse the type of supplementary performance chosen by the buyer without prejudice to [§ 275](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/275) paragraphs 2 and 3 if it is only possible with disproportionate costs. In particular, the value of the item in a defect-free condition, the importance of the defect and the question of whether the other type of supplementary performance could be used without significant disadvantages for the buyer. In this case, the buyer's claim is limited to the other type of supplementary performance; the seller's right to refuse this under the conditions of sentence 1 remains unaffected.
(5) If the seller delivers a defect-free item for the purpose of subsequent performance, he can request the buyer to return the defective item in accordance with §§ [346](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/346) to [348](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/348).
