(1) With regard to the claim of the creditor, the assertion of the right of retention only has the effect that the debtor is to be ordered to perform against receipt of the due performance (fulfillment step by step).
(2) On the basis of such a conviction, the creditor can pursue his claim by way of enforcement without effecting the performance incumbent on him, if the debtor is in default of acceptance.
