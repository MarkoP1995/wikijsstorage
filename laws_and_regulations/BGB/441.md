(1) Instead of withdrawing, the buyer can reduce the purchase price by explaining to the seller. The reason for exclusion in ยง 323 (5) sentence 2 does not apply.
(2) If several are involved on the side of the buyer or on the side of the seller, the reduction can only be declared by all or against all.
(3) In the case of a reduction, the purchase price is to be reduced in the ratio in which the value of the item in a defect-free condition would have been at the actual value at the time the contract was concluded. The reduction is, if necessary, to be estimated.
(4) If the buyer has paid more than the reduced purchase price, the additional amount must be reimbursed by the seller. ยง 346 (1) and ยง 347 (1) apply accordingly.
