(1) If a time for the performance is neither determined nor evident from the circumstances, the creditor can demand the performance immediately, the debtor can effect it immediately.
(2) If a time is determined, it can be assumed in doubt that the creditor does not require the performance before this time, but the debtor can effect it beforehand.
