Except in the cases of [ยง 281](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/281) paragraph 2 and [ยง 323](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/323) paragraph 2, the deadline is not required if the seller refuses both types of supplementary performance according to [ยง 439](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/439) paragraph 4 or if the type of supplementary performance due to the buyer has failed or is unreasonable for him . A rectification is considered to have failed after the second unsuccessful attempt, unless the nature of the thing or the defect or the other circumstances in particular do not indicate otherwise.
