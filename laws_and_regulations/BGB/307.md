(1) Provisions in general terms and conditions are ineffective if they unreasonably disadvantage the contractual partner of the user contrary to the requirements of good faith. Inappropriate disadvantage can also result from the fact that the provision is not clear and understandable.
(2) In case of doubt, an inadequate disadvantage is to be assumed if a provision
1. with essential basic ideas of the legal regulation, from which there is a deviation, is not compatible or
2. restricts essential rights or obligations arising from the nature of the contract in such a way that the achievement of the purpose of the contract is jeopardized.

(3) Paragraphs 1 and 2 as well as §§ [308](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/308) and [309](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/494) only apply to provisions in general terms and conditions by which provisions deviating from or supplementing legal provisions are agreed. Other provisions may be ineffective in accordance with paragraph 1 sentence 2 in conjunction with paragraph 1 sentence 1.
