In case of doubt, the order does not expire upon the death or the inability of the client to become legally incapable. If the order expires, the agent must, if there is a risk of postponement, continue to provide the assigned business until the heir or the client's legal representative can provide other care; In this respect, the order is considered to be ongoing.
