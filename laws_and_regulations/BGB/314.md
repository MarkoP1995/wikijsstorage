(1) Any part of the contract can terminate permanent obligations for good cause without observing a notice period. There is an important reason if the terminating part cannot be expected to continue the contractual relationship until the agreed termination or until a notice period has expired, taking into account all the circumstances of the individual case and weighing up the interests of both parties.
(2) If the important reason is a breach of an obligation from the contract, the termination is only permitted after the unsuccessful expiry of a period of time to remedy the situation or after unsuccessful warning. For the dispensability of determining a deadline for remedial action and for the dispensability of a warning, [ยง 323](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/323) (2) numbers 1 and 2 apply accordingly. The determination of a deadline for remedial action and a warning are also unnecessary if special circumstances exist that justify the immediate termination, taking into account the mutual interests.
(3) The beneficiary can only terminate within a reasonable period after becoming aware of the reason for the termination.
(4) The right to claim damages is not excluded by the termination.
