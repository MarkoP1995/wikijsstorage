(1) If the debtor fails to issue a reminder from the creditor that occurs after the due date, he will be in default by the reminder. The reminder is the same as the filing of a claim for performance and the delivery of a dunning notice in the dunning procedure.
(2) The warning is not required if
1. a time is determined according to the calendar for the performance,
2. the performance has to precede an event and a reasonable time for the performance is determined in such a way that it can be calculated from the event according to the calendar,
3. the debtor seriously and finally refuses to perform,
4. for special reasons, weighing the mutual interests, the immediate occurrence of the delay is justified.

(3) The debtor of a payment claim is in default at the latest if he does not pay within 30 days of the due date and receipt of an invoice or equivalent payment schedule; this applies to a debtor who is a consumer only if these consequences have been specifically indicated in the invoice or payment schedule. If the time of receipt of the invoice or payment schedule is uncertain, the debtor who is not a consumer is in default at the latest 30 days after the due date and receipt of the consideration.
(4) The debtor is not in default as long as the performance is not due to a circumstance for which he is not responsible.
(5) [ยง 271a](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/271a) paragraphs 1 to 5 shall apply mutatis mutandis to an agreement on the occurrence of default that differs from paragraphs 1 to 3.
