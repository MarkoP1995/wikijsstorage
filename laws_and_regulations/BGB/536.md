(1) If the rented property has a defect at the time of transfer to the tenant, which renders it unsuitable for use in accordance with the contract, or if such a defect arises during the rental period, the lessee is responsible for paying the rent for the period in which the rented property is canceled exempted. For the period during which the suitability is reduced, he only has to pay an appropriately reduced rent. An insignificant reduction in suitability is not taken into account.
1. For a period of three months, a reduction in suitability is not taken into account insofar as this occurs due to a measure that serves to energetically modernize in accordance with Section 555b number 1.

(2) Paragraph 1 sentences 1 and 2 also apply if a guaranteed property is missing or later disappears.
(3) If the tenant is completely or partially withdrawn from the use of the rental property in accordance with the contract by the law of a third party, paragraphs 1 and 2 apply accordingly.
(4) In the case of a rental agreement for living space, a different agreement to the disadvantage of the tenant is ineffective.
