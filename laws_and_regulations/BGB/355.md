(1) If a consumer is granted a right of withdrawal in accordance with this provision by law, the consumer and the entrepreneur are no longer bound by their declarations of intent aimed at the conclusion of the contract if the consumer has revoked his declaration of intent on time. The revocation is made by declaration to the entrepreneur. The consumer's decision to revoke the contract must be clear from the declaration. The revocation has no justification. Sending the revocation in time is sufficient for the Deadline.
(2) The cancellation period is 14 days. It begins with the conclusion of the contract, unless otherwise specified.
(3) In the event of cancellation, the services received must be returned immediately. If the law determines a maximum period for the restitution, this begins for the entrepreneur with the access and for the consumer with the submission of the declaration of revocation. A consumer meets this deadline by sending the goods in time. The entrepreneur bears the risk of returning the goods upon revocation.
