(1) If the debtor does not use the property contrary to the rules of an orderly economy, although it would have been possible, he is obliged to compensate the creditor. In the case of a statutory right of withdrawal, the beneficiary is only responsible for the care that he uses in his own affairs.
(2) If the debtor returns the item, pays compensation or if his obligation to pay compensation is excluded pursuant to [ยง 346](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/346) (3) No. 1 or 2, the necessary uses must be replaced. Other expenses are to be reimbursed if the creditor is enriched by them.
