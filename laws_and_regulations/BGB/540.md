(1) Without the landlord's permission, the lessee is not entitled to leave the use of the rental property to a third party, in particular to rent it out. If the landlord refuses permission, the tenant can terminate the tenancy extraordinarily with the statutory period, unless there is good cause in the person of the third party.
(2) If the tenant leaves the use to a third party, he is responsible for the fault of the third party in the use, even if the landlord has given permission for the transfer.
