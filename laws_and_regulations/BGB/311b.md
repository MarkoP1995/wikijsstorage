(1) A contract whereby one part commits to transfer or acquire ownership of a property requires notarial certification. A contract concluded without observing this form becomes valid in its entirety when it is released and entered in the land register.
(2) A contract whereby one part undertakes to transfer his future assets or a fraction of his future assets or to burden us with usufruct is void.
(3) A contract whereby one part commits to transfer its current assets or a fraction of its current assets or to burden it with usufruct requires notarial certification.
(4) A contract for the estate of a third party who is still alive is null and void. The same applies to a contract for the mandatory part or a legacy from the estate of a third party who is still alive.
(5) Paragraph 4 does not apply to a contract that is concluded between future legal heirs via the statutory inheritance portion or the mandatory portion of one of them. Such a contract requires notarial certification.
