(1) Insofar as the debtor does not provide the due payment or does not provide it as owed, the creditor can, under the conditions of [§ 280](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/280) (1), demand compensation instead of performance if he has unsuccessfully determined a reasonable period for performance or supplementary performance. If the debtor has effected a partial performance, the creditor can only claim damages instead of the entire performance if he is not interested in the partial performance. If the debtor has not effected the performance as owed, the creditor cannot demand compensation instead of the entire performance if the breach of duty is negligible.
(2) The setting of the deadline is not necessary if the debtor seriously and finally refuses to provide the service or if there are special circumstances which, taking into account the mutual interests, justify the immediate assertion of the claim for damages.
(3) If a deadline is not considered due to the nature of the breach of duty, a warning is given in its place.
(4) The claim to the service is excluded as soon as the creditor has requested compensation instead of the service.
(5) If the creditor demands compensation instead of the entire performance, the debtor is entitled to reclaim the service provided in accordance with §§ [346](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/346) to [348](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/348).
