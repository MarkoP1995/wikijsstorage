(1) As long as the parties have not agreed on all points of a contract about which even one party should agree upon an agreement, the contract is not concluded in case of doubt. The agreement on individual points is not binding even if a recording has taken place.
(2) If a notarization of the intended contract has been agreed, in case of doubt the contract is not concluded until the notarization has taken place.
