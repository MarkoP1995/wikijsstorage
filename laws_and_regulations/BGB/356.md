(1) The entrepreneur can grant the consumer the opportunity to fill out and submit the model withdrawal form in accordance with Appendix 2 to Article 246a § 1 paragraph 2 sentence 1 number 1 of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code or another clear declaration of withdrawal on the website of the entrepreneur. If the consumer makes use of this option, the entrepreneur must immediately confirm that the revocation has been received on a durable medium.
(2) The withdrawal period begins
1. when buying consumer goods,
		1. who does not fall under letters b to d as soon as the consumer or a third party designated by him, who is not a carrier, has received the goods,
		2. where the consumer has ordered several goods as part of a single order and the goods are delivered separately as soon as the consumer or a third party named by him, who is not a carrier, has received the last goods,
		3. in which the goods are delivered in several partial consignments or pieces as soon as the consumer or a third party named by the consumer who is not the carrier has received the last partial consignment or the last piece,
		4. which is aimed at the regular delivery of goods over a specified period as soon as the consumer or a third party designated by him, who is not a carrier, has received the first goods,
2. in the case of a contract that deals with the supply of water, gas or electricity, the supply of district heating or the delivery of digital content that is not on a physical data medium, in a limited volume or quantity, with the conclusion of the contract.

(3) The withdrawal period does not begin until the entrepreneur has informed the consumer in accordance with the requirements of Article 246a § 1 paragraph 2 sentence 1 number 1 or Article 246b § 2 paragraph 1 of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code. The right of withdrawal expires at the latest twelve months and 14 days after the time specified in paragraph 2 or § 355 paragraph 2 sentence 2. Sentence 2 does not apply to contracts for financial services.
(4) The right of withdrawal expires in the case of a contract for the provision of services even if the entrepreneur has rendered the service in full and only started to perform the service after the consumer has given his express consent and at the same time has confirmed his knowledge that he loses his right of withdrawal if the contractor has completely fulfilled the contract. In the case of a contract concluded outside of business premises, the consent of the consumer must be transmitted on a durable medium. In the case of a contract for the provision of financial services, the right of withdrawal differs from sentence 1 if the contract is completely fulfilled by both sides at the express request of the consumer before the consumer exercises his right of withdrawal.
(5) The right of withdrawal expires in the case of a contract for the delivery of digital content that is not on a physical data carrier even if the entrepreneur has started to execute the contract after the consumer
1. has expressly agreed that the entrepreneur starts executing the contract before the cancellation period expires, and
2. his knowledge has confirmed that his consent loses his right of withdrawal at the start of the execution of the contract.
