(1) The lease agreement obliges the lessor to grant the lessee the use of the leased item and the enjoyment of the fruit during the lease period insofar as they are to be regarded as income according to the rules of a proper economy. The lessee is obliged to pay the lessor the agreed lease.
(2) Unless otherwise stated in §§ [582](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/582) to [584b](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/584b), the provisions on the lease agreement are to be applied accordingly to the lease agreement with the exception of the land lease agreement.
