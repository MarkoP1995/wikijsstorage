If the debtor promises to pay the amount of money as a penalty to the creditor in the event that he does not fulfill his obligation or does not do so in a proper manner, the penalty is forfeited if he is in arrears. If the performance owed is a failure to perform, the forfeiture of the infringement occurs.
