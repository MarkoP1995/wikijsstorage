(1) If a legal transaction is carried out under a condition precedent, the effect made dependent on the condition occurs with the occurrence of the condition.
(2) If a legal transaction is carried out under a resolving condition, the effect of the legal transaction ends when the condition occurs; at this point the previous legal status will be restored.
