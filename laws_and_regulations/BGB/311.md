(1) A contract between the parties is required to establish a contractual relationship through a legal transaction and to change the content of a contractual relationship, unless the law prescribes otherwise.
(2) A contractual relationship with obligations under ยง 241 (2) also arises through
1. the start of contract negotiations,
2. the initiation of a contract in which one part grants the other part the possibility of influencing his rights, legal interests and interests with regard to a possible legal business relationship or entrusts them to him, or
3. similar business contacts.

(3) A contractual relationship with obligations in accordance with ยง 241 (2) can also arise to persons who should not themselves become a contracting party. Such a contractual relationship arises in particular if the third party particularly claims trust and thereby significantly influences the contract negotiations or the conclusion of the contract.
