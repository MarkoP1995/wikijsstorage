(1) If an entrepreneur uses the telemedia (contract in electronic commerce) for the purpose of concluding a contract for the delivery of goods or the provision of services, he has the customer
1. to provide adequate, effective and accessible technical means by means of which the customer can recognize and correct input errors before placing his order,
2. to provide the information specified in Article 246c of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code in a clear and understandable manner in good time before submitting its order,
3. to confirm the receipt of its order immediately electronically and
4. to enable the contract provisions including the general terms and conditions to be called up when the contract is concluded and saved in a reproducible form.

Orders and acknowledgments within the meaning of sentence 1 number 3 are deemed to have been received if the parties for whom they are intended can call them up under normal circumstances.
(2) Paragraph 1 sentence 1 numbers 1 to 3 does not apply if the contract is concluded solely through individual communication. Paragraph 1 sentence 1 number 1 to 3 and sentence 2 shall not apply if something different is agreed between contracting parties that are not consumers.
(3) Further information requirements based on other regulations remain unaffected.
