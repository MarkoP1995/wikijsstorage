(1) The effectiveness of a contract is not precluded by the fact that the debtor does not have to perform according to ยง 275 paras. 1 to 3 and that the obstacle to performance already exists when the contract is concluded.
(2) The creditor can choose to claim damages instead of performance or reimbursement of his expenses to the extent specified in ยง 284. This does not apply if the debtor did not know the obstacle to performance when the contract was concluded and is not responsible for his ignorance. ยง 281 (1) sentences 2 and 3 and (5) apply accordingly.
