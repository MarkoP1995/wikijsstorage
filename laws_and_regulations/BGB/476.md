(1) The entrepreneur cannot rely on an agreement made prior to notification of a defect to the entrepreneur, which deviates from §§ 433 to 435, 437, 439 to 443 and the provisions of this subtitle to the detriment of the consumer. The provisions referred to in sentence 1 also apply if they are circumvented by other designs.
(2) The statute of limitations of the claims referred to in § 437 cannot be relieved by legal transaction before notification of a defect to the entrepreneur if the agreement leads to a limitation period of less than two years from the statutory limitation period, or less than one year for used items.
(3) Without prejudice to §§ 307 to 309, paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply to the exclusion or limitation of the right to compensation.
