(1) Anyone who is obliged under a mutual contract can refuse the performance incumbent on him until the consideration is effected, unless he is obliged to do so. If the service has to be performed by more than one person, the part due to him can be refused until the entire consideration is effected. The provision of ยง 273 (3) does not apply.
(2) If part of the payment has been made, the consideration cannot be refused insofar as the refusal would be contrary to the principles of good faith, in particular due to the relatively insignificance of the part in arrears.
