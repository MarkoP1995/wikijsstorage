(1) The limitation of a claim for which a mortgage, a ship mortgage or a lien exists does not prevent the creditor from seeking satisfaction from the encumbered item.
(2) If a right has been procured to secure a claim, the retransfer cannot be requested due to the limitation period of the claim. If ownership is reserved, the contract can also be withdrawn if the secured claim is time-barred.
(3) Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply to the limitation period for claims to interest and other recurring benefits.
