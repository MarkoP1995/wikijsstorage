If the tenant knows the lack of the rented property when the contract is concluded, he is not entitled to the rights under sections 536 and 536a. If the defect remains unknown to him due to gross negligence, he is only entitled to these rights if the landlord has maliciously concealed the defect. If the tenant accepts a defective item, even though he knows the defect, he can only assert the rights under §§ 536 and 536a if he reserves his rights upon acceptance.
