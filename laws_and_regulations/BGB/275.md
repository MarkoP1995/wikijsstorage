(1) The right to performance is excluded insofar as this is impossible for the debtor or for everyone.
(2) The debtor can refuse the performance insofar as this requires an effort that is grossly disproportionate to the creditor's interest in performance, taking into account the content of the contractual relationship and the requirements of good faith. When determining the efforts to be expected of the debtor, consideration must also be given to whether the debtor is responsible for the obstacle to performance.
(3) The debtor can also refuse to perform if he has to provide the service personally and it cannot be reasonably expected from the creditor's performance, taking into account the obstacle to his performance.
(4) The rights of the creditor are determined in accordance with sections [280](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/280), [283](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/283) to [285](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/285), [311a](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/311a) and [326](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/326).
