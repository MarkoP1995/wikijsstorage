(1) The claims referred to in § 634 No. 1, 2 and 4 expire
1. subject to number 2 in two years at a plant, the success of which consists in the manufacture, maintenance or modification of a thing or in the provision of planning or monitoring services for this,
2. in five years for a structure and a plant the success of which is the provision of planning or monitoring services therefor, and
3. otherwise in the regular limitation period.

(2) In the cases of subsection 1 numbers 1 and 2, the limitation period begins with the acceptance.
(3)In derogation from Paragraph 1 Nos. 1 and 2 and Paragraph 2, the claims become statute-barred in the regular limitation period if the entrepreneur has maliciously concealed the defect. In the case of paragraph 1 number 2, however, the limitation does not occur before the expiry of the period specified there.
(4) § 218 applies to the right of withdrawal referred to in § 634. Despite the invalidity of the withdrawal pursuant to Section 218 (1), the customer can refuse to pay the remuneration insofar as he would be entitled to do so due to the withdrawal. If he exercises this right, the entrepreneur can withdraw from the contract.
(5) § 218 and Paragraph 4 Clause 2 apply accordingly to the right to reduction specified in Section 634.
