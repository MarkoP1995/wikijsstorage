If text form is prescribed by law, a legible declaration in which the person of the declarant is named must be made on a durable medium. A permanent medium is any medium that
1. enables the recipient to store or store a declaration on the data carrier, addressed to him personally, in such a way that it is accessible to him for a reasonable period of time, and
2. is suitable to reproduce the declaration unchanged.
