(1) The rights of the buyer due to a defect are excluded if he knows the defect when the contract is concluded. If the purchaser is not aware of a defect due to gross negligence, the purchaser can only assert rights due to this defect if the seller has maliciously concealed the defect or has given a guarantee for the quality of the item.
(2) The seller must remove a right entered in the land register, even if the buyer knows it.
