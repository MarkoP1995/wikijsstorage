(1) If the debtor has a due claim against the creditor from the same legal relationship on which his obligation is based, he can, unless the debt relationship results in another, refuse the performance owed until the performance due to him is effected (right of retention) .
(2) Anyone who is obliged to surrender an item has the same right if he is entitled to a claim due to the use of the item or due to damage caused to it, unless he has obtained the item through a deliberate act of tort.
(3) The creditor can avert the exercise of the right of retention by providing security. The guarantee by guarantors is excluded.
