(1) On websites for electronic business transactions with consumers, in addition to the information in accordance with Section 312i (1), the entrepreneur must state clearly and clearly at the latest at the start of the ordering process whether there are delivery restrictions and which means of payment are accepted.
(2) In the case of a consumer contract in electronic commerce that involves a service rendered by the entrepreneur, the entrepreneur must provide the consumer with the information pursuant to Article 246a ยง 1 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 Numbers 1, 4, 5, 11 and 12 of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code, directly before the consumer places his order, clearly and understandably in a highlighted manner.
(3) The entrepreneur has to design the order situation for a contract according to paragraph 2 in such a way that the consumer expressly confirms with his order that he undertakes to make a payment. If the order is placed via a button, the entrepreneur's duty from sentence 1 is only fulfilled if this button is clearly legible with nothing other than the words "order with payment" or is labeled with a corresponding clear wording.
(4) A contract according to paragraph 2 is only concluded if the entrepreneur fulfills his obligation from paragraph 3.
(5) Paragraphs 2 to 4 do not apply if the contract is concluded solely through individual communication. The obligations under paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply to websites that relate to financial services or to contracts for financial services.
