(1) The purchaser is obliged to accept the contractually manufactured work, unless the acceptance is not possible due to the nature of the work. Acceptance cannot be refused due to minor defects.
(2) A work is also deemed to have been accepted if the entrepreneur has given the customer a reasonable period for acceptance after completion of the work and the customer has not refused acceptance within this period, stating at least one defect. If the customer is a consumer, the legal consequences of sentence 1 only occur if the entrepreneur, together with the request for acceptance, has informed the customer of the consequences of an unexplained or refused acceptance without stating defects; the notice must be given in text form.
(3) If the customer accepts a defective work in accordance with paragraph 1 sentence 1, even though he knows the defect, he is only entitled to the rights specified in ยง 634 nos. 1 to 3 if he reserves his rights due to the defect upon acceptance.
