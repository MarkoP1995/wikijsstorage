(1) If the debtor has promised the punishment in the event that he does not fulfill his obligation, the creditor can demand the punishment forfeited instead of the fulfillment. If the creditor declares to the debtor that he is demanding the penalty, the right to performance is excluded.
(2) If the creditor is entitled to compensation for non-performance, he can demand the penalty imposed as a minimum amount of the damage. The assertion of further damage is not excluded.
