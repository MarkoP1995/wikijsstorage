(1) General terms and conditions are all terms and conditions pre-formulated for a large number of contracts that one contracting party (user) provides to the other contracting party when a contract is concluded. It is irrelevant whether the provisions form an externally separate part of the contract or are included in the contract document, what scope they have, in which font they are written and what form the contract has. General terms and conditions do not exist if the contractual terms have been negotiated between the contracting parties in detail.
(2) General terms and conditions only become part of a contract if the user at the time the contract is concluded
1. the other contracting party expressly or, if an express reference to the nature of the contract is only possible with disproportionate difficulties, by means of a clearly visible notice at the place of the contract conclusion and
2. gives the other party the opportunity to take reasonable notice of its content, which also adequately takes into account any physical disability of the other party that is recognizable to the user,
3. and if the other party agrees to their validity.

(3) The contracting parties may agree in advance the application of certain general terms and conditions for a certain type of legal transaction, taking into account the requirements set out in paragraph 2.
