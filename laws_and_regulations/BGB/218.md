(1) Withdrawal due to performance not performed or not performed in accordance with the contract is ineffective if the entitlement to the performance or the right to subsequent performance is time-barred and the debtor invokes it. This also applies if the debtor does not have to pay according to [§ 275](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/275) Paragraph 1 to 3, [§ 439](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/439) Paragraph 4 or [§ 635](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/635) Paragraph 3 and the entitlement to the service or the right to subsequent performance would be time-barred. [§ 216](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/216) (2) sentence 2 remains unaffected.
(2) [§ 214](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/214) (2) applies accordingly.
