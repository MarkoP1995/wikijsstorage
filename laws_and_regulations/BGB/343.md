(1) If a penalty that has been forfeited is disproportionately high, it can be reduced to the appropriate amount by judgment at the request of the debtor. When assessing appropriateness, every legitimate interest of the creditor, not just the interests of the property, must be taken into account. After the penalty has been paid, the reduction is excluded.
(2) The same also applies except in the cases of §§ [339](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/339), [342](/laws_and_regulations/BGB/342), if someone promises a punishment if he takes or fails to take an action.
