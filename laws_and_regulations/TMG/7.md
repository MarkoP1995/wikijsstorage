(1) Service providers are responsible for their own information, which they make available for use, according to general laws.
(2) Service providers within the meaning of sections 8 to 10 are not obliged to monitor the information transmitted or stored by them or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
(3) Obligations to remove information or to block the use of information according to general laws due to judicial or official orders remain unaffected even in the event of the service provider not being responsible according to Sections 8 to 10. The confidentiality of telecommunications according to ยง 88 of the Telecommunications Act must be preserved.
(4) If a telemedia service was used by a user in order to violate the intellectual property right of another and there is no other way for the owner of this right to remedy the violation of his right, the owner of the right can be removed from the service provider concerned to block the use of information in accordance with Section 8 (3) in order to prevent the repeated infringement. The block must be reasonable and proportionate. A claim against the service provider for reimbursement of the pre-judicial and extrajudicial costs for the assertion and enforcement of the claim according to sentence 1 does not exist except in the cases of ยง 8 paragraph 1 sentence 3.
