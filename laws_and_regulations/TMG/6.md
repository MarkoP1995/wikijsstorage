(1) Service providers must observe at least the following requirements for commercial communications that are telemedia or components of telemedia:
1. Commercial communications must be clearly recognizable as such.
2. The natural or legal person on whose behalf commercial communications are carried out must be clearly identifiable.
3. Promotional offers, such as discounts, bonuses, and gifts, must be clearly identifiable as such, and the conditions for using them must be easily accessible and clearly and unambiguously stated.
4. Contests or competitions with advertising character must be clearly recognizable as such and the conditions of participation must be easily accessible and clearly and unambiguously stated.

(2) If commercial communications are sent by electronic mail, neither the sender nor the commercial character of the message may be obscured or concealed in the header and subject line. It is obfuscated or concealed if the header and subject line are intentionally designed so that the recipient does not receive any or misleading information about the actual identity of the sender or the commercial nature of the message before viewing the content of the communication.
(3) The provisions of the law against unfair competition remain unaffected.
