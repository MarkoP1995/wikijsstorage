Service providers are not responsible for external information that they store for a user, provided that
1. they have no knowledge of the illegal act or the information and, in the event of claims for damages, they are not aware of any facts or circumstances from which the illegal act or the information becomes obvious, or
2. they acted immediately to remove the information or block access to it as soon as they became aware of it.

Sentence 1 does not apply if the user is subordinate to the service provider or is supervised by him.
