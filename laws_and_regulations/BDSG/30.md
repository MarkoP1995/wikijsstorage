(1) A body that collects, stores or changes business-related personal data, which may be used to assess the creditworthiness of consumers for the purpose of transmission, has to deal with requests for information from lenders from other Member States of the European Union as well as requests for information from domestic lenders.
(2) Anyone who refuses to conclude a consumer loan contract or a contract for financial assistance against payment with a consumer as a result of information provided by a body within the meaning of paragraph 1, must immediately inform the consumer thereof and of the information received.
