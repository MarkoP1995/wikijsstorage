(1) The Bundeskartellamt shall prohibit a merger which would significantly impede effective competition, in particular which is expected to create or strengthen a dominant position. This does not apply if
1. the undertakings concerned demonstrate that the merger will also improve the competitive environment and outweigh the obstacle to competition, or
2. the prohibition requirements of sentence 1 exist on a market on which goods or commercial services have been offered for at least five years and on which less than 15 million euros were converted in the last calendar year, unless it is a market within the meaning of ยง 18 paragraph 2a or a case of ยง 35 paragraph 1a, or
3. the dominant position of a newspaper or magazine publisher is taken over, which takes over a small or medium-sized newspaper or magazine publisher, if it can be demonstrated that the acquired publisher has a significant annual loss in the profit and loss account according to ยง 275 of the Commercial Code in the last three years had to be shown and he would have been endangered without the merger. It must also be demonstrated that no other buyer could have been found before the merger who would have ensured a more competitive solution.

(2) If a participating company is a dependent or dominant company within the meaning of Section 17 of the German Stock Corporation Act or a group company within the meaning of Section 18 of the German Stock Corporation Act, the affiliated companies are to be regarded as a single company. If several companies work together in such a way that they can exercise a controlling influence on another company, each of them is considered to be the dominant one.
(3) If a person or association of persons who is not a company is entitled to a majority stake in a company, it is considered a company.
