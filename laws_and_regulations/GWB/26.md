(1) Recognition takes place by decision of the antitrust authority. Its content is that the anti-trust authority will not exercise its powers under Chapter 6.
(2) Insofar as a competition rule violates the prohibition of § 1 and is not exempt according to §§ 2 and 3 or violates other provisions of this law, the law against unfair competition or another legal provision, the antitrust authority must reject the application for recognition .
(3) Business and professional associations must notify the antitrust authority of the overriding of recognized competition rules that they have drawn up.
(4) The antitrust authority must withdraw or revoke the recognition if it subsequently determines that the requirements for the refusal of recognition pursuant to paragraph 2 are met.
