(1) A merger exists in the following cases:
1. Acquisition of the property of another company in whole or in part; this also applies if a company operating in Germany whose assets are acquired has not yet achieved any sales revenue;
2. Acquisition of direct or indirect control by one or more companies over all or part of one or more other companies. The control is based on rights, contracts or other means which, individually or together, taking into account all factual and legal circumstances, give the possibility, particularly through, of exerting a decisive influence on the activity of a company
		1. Rights of ownership or use of all or part of the company's assets,
		2. Rights or contracts that have a determining influence on the composition, the deliberations or decisions of the organs of the company;

this also applies if a company operating in Germany has not yet generated any sales;

3. Acquisition of shares in another company if the shares alone or together with other shares that already belong to the company
		1. 50 of a hundred or
		2. 25 of a hundred
4. of the capital or voting rights of the other company. The shares belonging to the company also include the shares that belong to another for the account of this company and, if the owner of the company is a sole trader, also the shares that are other assets of the owner. If several companies simultaneously or successively acquire shares in the above-mentioned scope in another company, this also applies to the markets in which the other company operates, as an amalgamation of the participating companies;
5. any other connection of companies, on the basis of which one or more companies can directly or indirectly exert a significant competitive influence on another company.

(2) A merger also exists if the companies involved were previously merged, unless the merger does not significantly strengthen the existing business relationship.
(3) If credit institutions, financial institutions or insurance companies acquire shares in another company for the purpose of sale, this does not count as a merger as long as they do not exercise the voting rights from the shares and if the sale takes place within one year. The Bundeskartellamt can extend this period on request if it can be demonstrated that the sale was unreasonable within the period.
