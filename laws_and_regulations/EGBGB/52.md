If, on the basis of a Reich law, the owner of a thing is to be compensated for the confiscation, damage or use of the thing in the public interest or for limitation of property, and a third party has a right to the thing for which no special compensation is granted , the third party, insofar as his right is impaired, has the same rights to the compensation claim that he is entitled to in the event that his right is extinguished by foreclosure.
