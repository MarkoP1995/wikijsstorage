(1) If reference is made to the law of another state, its international private law shall also apply, unless this contradicts the meaning of the reference. If the law of the other country refers back to German law, the German substantive regulations are to be applied.
(2) References to substantive provisions refer to the legal norms of the relevant legal system, excluding those of private international law. As far as the parties can choose the law of a state, they can only refer to the factual regulations.
(3) If reference is made to the law of a state with several sub-legal systems without specifying the relevant one, the law of that state determines which sub-legal system is to be applied. If there is no such regulation, the sub-legal system with which the facts are most closely connected is to be applied.
