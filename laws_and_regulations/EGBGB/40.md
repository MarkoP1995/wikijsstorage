(1) Claims arising from tortious acts are subject to the law of the state in which the liable party acted. The injured party may request that the law of the country in which the success occurred was applied instead of this right. The right of determination can only be exercised in the first instance until the end of the early first appointment or the end of the preliminary written procedure.
(2) If the person liable to pay compensation and the injured were habitually resident in the same state at the time of the liability event, the law of that state shall apply. In the case of companies, associations or legal entities, the place of habitual residence is the place where the head office is located or, if a branch is involved, where it is located.
(3) Claims that are subject to the law of another state cannot be asserted insofar as they
1. go far beyond what is necessary to adequately compensate the injured,
2. serve purposes other than adequate compensation to the injured party or
3. contradict liability regulations of a convention binding for the Federal Republic of Germany.

(4) The injured person can assert his claim directly against an insurer of the party liable to pay compensation if the law applicable to the tort or the law to which the insurance contract is subject so provides.
