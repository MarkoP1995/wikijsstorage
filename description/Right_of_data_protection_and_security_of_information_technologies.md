Data protection law, as laid down in the Federal Data Protection Act ([BDSG](/laws_and_regulations/BDSG)) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation ([DSGVO](/laws_and_regulations/DSGVO)), gives citizens extensive rights to protect their personal data. At the same time, this results in corresponding obligations for data-gathering bodies such as authorities or companies.
