The Internet is not a legal vacuum. Therefore, the general legal basis also applies unreservedly in e-commerce ([BGB](/laws_and_regulations/BGB), Commercial Code, Law on General Terms and Conditions, [UrhG](/laws_and_regulations/UrhG), Consumer Credit Law, Commercial Code, Unfair Competition Law, [StGB](/laws_and_regulations/StGB/166) and so on). Special legal provisions now exist for certain sub-areas.
