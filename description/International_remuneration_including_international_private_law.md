Since it cannot be prevented that information technologies are used across borders, private international law must inevitably apply in this area. International private law is in no way to be equated or confused with international law, which is also called international law. In addition to international private law, international procedural law is applied, which is subject to each state itself. So far, private international law has been heavily influenced by American private law.
