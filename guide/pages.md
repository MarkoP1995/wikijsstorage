# Create a Page
There're multiple ways to create a new pages:

From the New Page button, located at the top-right corner of the page.
- By clicking a link pointing to a non-existing page.
- Manually type the path in the browser address bar.

Check out the [Basics](/guide/intro) guide on how to create your first page step-by-step.

# Edit a Page
You can edit an existing page by clicking the **Pencil** icon at the bottom-right corner of any page or using the **Page Menu**, located at the top-right corner of the page.

The editor selected when first creating the page will be loaded automatically. Note that it's not possible to change editor once a page is created at the moment.

# Folders
Wiki.js doesn't rely on a traditional folder structure to organize pages. Instead, the path of the page is used.

For example, on a traditional system, in order to create a page at `universe/planets/earth`, you'd need to first create a folder `universe`, then open this folder and create a sub-folder named `planets` to finally be able to create a page inside named `earth`.

In Wiki.js, you can directly create a page at path `universe/planets/earth`. Folders `universe` and `planets` will be automatically inferred, but they don't really exist outside of the page path context. Therefore, you don't have to manage folders and you can instead focus solely on the path you want for your pages.

For this reason, there's no option to create folders. Simply type the full path you want. Folders will be inferred automatically upon creation.
