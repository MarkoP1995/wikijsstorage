1. Select the language to create the page for (*the current locale is selected by default*).
2. Enter the full path to the page you want to create.
- The path should contain no spaces (use dashes instead), no periods and consists of URL-safe characters.
- **DO NOT** put a trailing slash.
- You don't need to create folders. Enter the full path you want to create and folders will be created automatically. For example, enter universe/planets/earth to automatically create the universe and planets subfolders.
3. Click Select to proceed.

## Select an Editor
When creating a new page, you'll be prompted with the following dialog:

## Save

Your page is not created until you hit the **Create** button (located in the upper-right corner of the page). It will be saved and rendered, after which you'll automatically be redirected to the final result. Simply click the edit button to go back to editing!
